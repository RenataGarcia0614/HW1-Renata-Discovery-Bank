## Overview and Origin

* Name of company:  Discovery Bank

* When was the company incorporated? March 1992 in South Africa  

* Who are the founders of the company? Adrian Gore 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
Adrian stated the reasoning behind Discovery ZA 
A need for instant gratification often pervades 
Applying Discovery’s shared value to banking 
By changing behavior lead to create value and compete in three dimensions


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? The company was funded by money Adrian had received from his stake in Rand Merchant Bank. From there the company jumped from RMB to FirstRand. 
Here the company acquired most of the funding from its IPO.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Adrian explains that for certain things in our lives can be explained by 5 behaviors. He believes this is the same with banking. Five simple behaviors can explain 80% of credit default risk and why individuals do not manage their money well. 
In my opinion this is how I interpret: 

Learn the customers' behavior, Change their irrational choice, Enable smart financial choices 




* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The South African population. “ South Africans tend to be big borrowers and poor savers. 53% of South Africans borrowed money and 2017 and despite affordability requirements and efforts to increase consumer awareness, credit use is outpacing employment growth” 
From their annual report:
Current Market Size: 25.7 Million 
2025 Goal: 100 million

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Discovery Bank claims to be the FIRST behavioral bank. They offer the Vitaly Money platform which analyzes consumer choices. Backed by behavioral theory, they claim that “south Africans” are not inclined towards rational choices. Leading most of them to have financial problems. They focus on instant gratification, making banking easy to understand, and fun to participate in healthy banking.

(This is very true, I have friends who live in South Africa and live close to bankruptcy every day. It’s the norm over there)

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Personal Finance & Online Banking 


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Customer Experience and Interaction: Each individual is more than their account number; all have different lifestyles, culture, and decision making 
Real-Time Info: API’s play a huge role in real-time info. 
Branded Credit Cards and Reward Systems: (Amazon Cards, Venmo, Apple)
Gen Z Awareness: accessibility to online banking, money management, and emphasizes the ability to save

2020 Trends: 
Combined effects of tech description, nature of work, demographic shifts, climate change, and possible Japanification → implications for the banking industry 
Banking will be more open, transparent, real-time, intelligent, tailored, secure, seamless, and deeply integrated into consumers lives 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Behavioural banking seems to be the new frontier in banking, but Discovery has led the way in South Africa. When it comes to behavioral banking in the US, I really could not find much information on banking that examines an individual's every move, like Discovery bank. In the digital banking world, Discovery is competing against new banks everyday. Bank Zero is planned to launch in late 2020. Counting Bank Zero, the compeitrios landscape is about 10 different service providers. 



## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Taking their core values in mind, their behavioral banking platform allows them to boost their capability of changing financial habits. Currently, they operate in 20 countries and impact 25.7 million. (If you think about it, that's a low number if you are in 20 countries)
It seems this company has bundled various financial products and sort of games to attract their consumers. By their strategy of instant gratification, they have tapped into what South Africans need the most, a bit of extra cash. 
Most South Africans do not understand the basic concepts of savings and retirement planning. They successfully embedded themselves in that niche, but the downfall is most South Africans do not have the education sought this kind of technology. 

Company Highlights:
* Discovery named second strongest insurance brand 
* Embedded Value highest in 2019 R73184
* Invested more than R230 Million for healthcare in South Africa 


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?


After reading the financial reports, its sort of unsettling to see they did not mention how they came about their numbers or even shared some basic formula. All they would state about metrics is “strong performance across key business metrics”

Metrics 2019:
* Operating profit -3% R7.7bn 
* New Business +13% R18.3bn 
* Jump in profit since 2018 +16% to R6533 million 
* Normalized Operating Profit of R7747 Million 
* Investment into new initiatives 21%

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Disovery is the first behavioral banking in South Africa. This gives the competitive advantage above the rest. However, we are seeing a new bank emerge "Bank Zero." [Bank Zero](https://www.theafricareport.com/23101/bank-zero-says-its-set-to-launch-in-south-africa-in-middle-of-this-year/) taps into the the beahvior of secuity provided by cards. They strive to protect the wealth of South African. Whom unfortunately, have lost R873 (US$58mm) in 2018. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

This might be a bit unorthodox, but to make something successful you don't necessarily have to change it. I would not change the concept of behavioral banking provided by Discovery. If Discovery's full digital experience was offered here in the US, I would be a loyal customer. However, just because I decide not to change the concept, I would push to change their process flow, their marketing strategy, and add to their current technologies. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Immediately when you open up Discovery’s webpage you are bombarded with tons of information relating to their cutting edge baking system. It took me lots of reading, calling my south African friends, and drawing to fully understand the scope of their program. Now, this is me, an individual who has a good amount of financial literary. Keeping in mind their target market, they have to be able to market themselves more directly and not overwhelm their new customer. They could do this by creating mini infographic videos that serve to walk the customer through the entire process step by step, almost hand holding them. Also, many South Africans do not have the resources to have a top of the line phones. (Kid you not one of my friends told me that a nearby hospital in Cape Town was asking for iPhones to be donated so family members could see they dying COVID loved one for the last time)
Back to the point, I would set up booths where there could be heavy foot traffic. This could be the touristic points of Cape town and some of the townships. 

For their behavioral banking, I love the concept. You know to be a finance major I struggle to not spend above my means. The downfall of watching your customers every move is that no one wants that. Especially here in the USA. If Discovery would want to implement their tech here in the US, they would have to extremely transparent on to what extent they are scouring through your data. (Vitality, a discovery branch off is offered here in the US, but only marketed to big companies) The goal is to market this to Gen Z, and millennials. Why? Because most of the GenZ kids do not know life before all this technology. As for millennials, we are known to spend more than what we have or “treat ourselves” constantly. We need more structure in regards to our finances, and if you can accomplish that by implementing a fun way to do it, sign me up!!


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
For the technology aspect, Discovery should strive to implement smart contracts into their current technologies.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
I know they use IoT, but I believe a smart contract would be more beneficial in the way they manage millions of data sets. Also,this could help improve the accuracy of each individual's financial behaviors. Smart contacts offer secure, fast performing, and accurate information. If they can market this in a way anyone across the world could understand they could increase their consumer target. Maintaining privacy is key, Discovery has to build its foundation from that simple concept.
